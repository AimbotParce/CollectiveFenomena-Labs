   abstract = {The questions that follow on this and succeeding sheets are an integral part of this course. The code beside each question has the following significance: • K: key question-explores core material • R: review question-an invitation to consolidate • C: challenge question-going beyond the basic framework of the course • S: standard question-general fitness training! 2.1 Revision of Model Magnet [r] When a particle with spin 1 / 2 is placed in a magnetic field H, its energy level is split into ±µH and it has a magnetic moment µ or −µ along the direction of the magnetic field, respectively. Suppose that an assembly of N such particles on a lattice is placed in a magnetic field H and is kept at temperature T. Find the internal energy, the entropy, the heat capacity and the total magnetic moment M of this assembly. Sketch the internal energy and heat capacity, identifying and analyisng the low temperature and high temperature regimes. 2.2 Magnetisation Fluctuations in General Magnetic System [s] An assembly of spin 1/2 at a fixed temperature T is subject to an applied magnetic field H. If the net magnetic moment of the assembly in state i is M i , in the direction of the field, then the associated total energy is given by E i = E i (H = 0) − µ 0 M i H , where E i (H = 0) represents the mutual interaction of the individual spins in the absence of an external field, and µ 0 is the permeability of free space. Show that fluctuations of the magnetic moment about its mean value are given by ∆M 2 ≡ ≡M 2 − −M 2 = kT χ µ 0 where χ is the isothermal magnetic susceptibility defined by χ = [∂M /∂H] T. 2.3 Quantum rotor: classical and quantum limits [s] r = ¯ h 2 2I r(r + 1) , r = 0, 1, 2... where I is a constant and the level r is (2r + 1)-fold degenerate. (a) Write down the canonical partition function of the rotational motion, and obtain manageable approximations for it (i) at low temperatures and (ii) at high ones. [Hint: to decide on suitable approximations, consider in each limit how many terms matter in the sum. If only one or two terms matter, neglect the rest. If many matter, consider how a sum of many terms (if the summand is slowly varying) can be approximated by an integral.] (b) Find the mean energy E(T) in each limit and hence obtain expressions for the heat capacity at low and high temperatures. [Answers: c V,rot = 3¯ h 4 I −2 k −1 B T −2 exp[−β¯ h 2 /I] 0 for k B T 1 ; c V,rot = k B for large T .]},

   abstract = {The grand canonical ensemble is a generalization of the canonical ensemble where the restriction to a definite number of particles is removed. This is a realistic representation when then the total number of particles in a macroscopic system cannot be fixed. Heat and particle reservoir. Consider a system A 1 in a heat and particle reservoir A 2. The two systems are in equilibrium with the thermal equilibrium.-Thermal equilibrium results form the exchange of heat. The two temperature are then equal: T = T 1 = T 2-The equilibrium with respect to particle exchange leads to identical chemical potentials: µ = µ 1 = µ 2. Energy and particle conservation. We assume that the system A 2 is much larger than the system A 1 , i.e., that E 2 � E 1 , N 2 � N 1 , with N 1 + N 2 = N = const. E 1 + E 2 = E = const. where N and E are the particle number and the energy of the total system A = A 1 + A 2 .},

@article{markovChains,
   abstract = {'A fascinating and instructive guide to Markov chains for experienced users and newcomers alike This unique guide to Markov chains approaches the subject along the four convergent lines of mathematics, implementation, simulation, and experimentation. It introduces readers to the art of stochastic modeling, shows how to design computer implementations, and provides extensive worked examples with case studies. Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation begins with a general introduction to the history of probability theory in which the author uses quantifiable examples to illustrate how probability theory arrived at the concept of discrete-time and the Markov model from experiments involving independent variables. An introduction to simple stochastic matrices and transition probabilities is followed by a simulation of a two-state Markov chain. The notion of steady state is explored in connection with the long-run distribution behavior of the Markov chain. Predictions based on Markov chains with more than two states are examined, followed by a discussion of the notion of absorbing Markov chains. Also covered in detail are topics relating to the average time spent in a state, various chain configurations, and n-state Markov chain simulations used for verifying experiments involving various diagram configurations. - Fascinating historical notes shed light on the key ideas that led to the development of the Markov model and its variants - Various configurations of Markov Chains and their limitations are explored at length - Numerous examples'from basic to complex'are presented in a comparative manner using a variety of color graphics - All algorithms presented can be analyzed in either Visual Basic, Java Script, or PHP - Designed to be useful to professional statisticians as well as readers without extensive knowledge of probability theory Covering both the theory underlying the Markov model and an array of Markov chain implementations, within a common conceptual framework, Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation is a stimulating introduction to and a valuable reference for those wishing to deepen their understanding of this extremely valuable statistical tool.

@article{markovStochastic,
   abstract = {2nd ed. Meyn and Tweedie is back! The bible on Markov chains in general state spaces has been brought up to date to reflect developments in the field since 1996 - many of them sparked by publication of the first edition. The pursuit of more efficient simulation algorithms for complex Markovian models, or algorithms for computation of optimal policies for controlled Markov models, has opened new directions for research on Markov chains. As a result, new applications have emerged across a wide range of topics including optimisation, statistics, and economics. New commentary and an epilogue by Sean Meyn summarise recent developments and references have been fully updated. This second edition reflects the same discipline and style that marked out the original and helped it to become a classic: proofs are rigorous and concise, the range of applications is broad and knowledgeable, and key ideas are accessible to practitioners with limited mathematical background.
